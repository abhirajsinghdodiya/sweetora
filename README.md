## My AI Usage

### AI Tool Used

* ChatGPT (OpenAI)

### How I Used AI

I am a beginner in web development, so I used ChatGPT mainly to understand concepts and setup steps. It helped me understand the project structure, configure PostgreSQL, set up environment variables, and interpret errors during development. I also used it to understand how the frontend, backend, and database are connected.

### Reflection

ChatGPT acted as a learning assistant rather than replacing my work. It helped me understand what I was building and why certain steps were required. All final code integration, setup, and testing were done by me.
